# What is "Zephyr"?

The codename Zephyr Cycling project is an attempt to turn a "dumb" hardware switched 120V fan into a smart cycling fan with minimal (albeit invasive) electrical changes. This project will enable compatible fans to connect to a heart rate monitor to auto scale with user effort while remaining in fan speeds/modes supported by your device, while also enabling the user to manually switch the fan through button presses.

## Overview

While the features and functionality are somewhat straight forward, here's a short overview.

## How was this built?

### Hardware

This project was built using 2 [Raspberry Pi PicoW](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html) microcontrollers, a set of 120V relays, buttons and 5mm LEDs.

### Software

This project uses Micropython to implement the 'smart' functionality. It depends on several other incredible projects/works from other developers to help make this possible.

## Can I see it in action?

The production values of these videos is quite low ðŸ˜‚. But here's some initial testing of the unit running for my own purposes. I did complete the first ride using it on March 7th, 2024 and it worked a treat!

## What's Next?

I'd love to be able to put some time into learning KiCAD (or similar software) to provision a schematic or PCB to make adapting this project for DIYers a little less cumbersome. I have limited experience in EDA tools but it's on my list of things I'd like to get more familiar with!
